## 🤗&nbsp; Welcome to The Neob Project

Hi, my name is [Raul Bras](https://github.com/teknolista). I'm a software engineer from 🇧🇷 Brazil and the creator of 🔰 **Neob** — a next generation, multipurpose programming language that transpiles to **JavaScript**. Neob is designed to help beginners learn programming more easily, while also providing the tools to build reliable, efficient, and high-performance software.

The first draft of the language grammar is ready ([neob-grammar](https://github.com/neob-lang/neob-grammar)), and now I'm starting to program the parser ([neob](https://github.com/neob-lang/neob)), using [Antlr4](https://www.antlr.org/). I'm also preparing the website ([www.neob-lang.org](https://www.neob-lang.org/en/)), writing the documentation ([en.neob-lang.org](https://en.neob-lang.org/)), and translating everything from Portuguese ([pt.neob-lang.org](https://pt.neob-lang.org/)). In addition, I plan to release a VS Code extension, but for now I'm still creating syntax highlighting using TextMate's grammar ([vscode-neob](https://github.com/neob-lang/vscode-neob)). It's not an easy task, and I expect it to be a years-long project.

## 🔰&nbsp; Born of Desire, Shaped by Practicality

The Neob language was born from a desire to help ordinary people to learn how to code.

## 🌐&nbsp; The Ubiquity of JavaScript

Neob code is transpiled to **JavaScript**, the most ubiquitous programming language of the modern computing era. Present in browsers, servers, mobile devices, desktop applications, and even embedded systems, JavaScript offers unparalleled reach: **write once, run anywhere**. Its massive ecosystem — with millions of libraries, tools, and mature runtimes — enables complete applications to be built, distributed, and executed with remarkable ease, from frontend to backend.

JavaScript combines a high-level execution model, automatic garbage collection, dynamic typing (with optional static typing via TypeScript), and a secure runtime, eliminating entire classes of errors common in low-level languages. At the same time, modern engines such as **V8, SpiderMonkey, and JavaScriptCore** apply aggressive optimizations, JIT compilation, and advanced runtime techniques, delivering performance that is more than sufficient for the vast majority of real-world applications, even at large scale.

By transpiling to JavaScript, Neob inherits **instant portability, safety by default, and a gigantic ecosystem**, while simultaneously fixing JavaScript’s historical weaknesses — such as semantic inconsistencies, dangerous implicit coercions, and poorly designed APIs. Neob acts as a **disciplined software engineering layer**, enforcing clear rules, compile-time checks, and consistent abstractions that make code predictable, readable, and easy to maintain.

This approach allows beginners to learn programming and software engineering without fighting subtle language pitfalls, while experienced developers gain productivity without sacrificing robustness. The result is a modern, pedagogical, and safe language that delivers real-world applications on top of one of the most battle-tested platforms on the planet.

## 💖&nbsp; Open Source, Open Contribution, Open Mind, Open Heart

Neob was born as a programming language offered to the world as a gift to humanity, a creative gesture that isn't tied to owners or corporations, but expresses itself as a free path for anyone who wishes to embark on the journey of computer programming. This means you can freely learn, practice, and create software with this language, exploring its possibilities and expanding its ecosystem. By using it, you become part of a community that shares knowledge and contributes to the growth and benefit of this language.

## 👨‍🍳&nbsp; Anyone Can Code (and Cook)

The phrase of the banner above is a paraphrase of Gusteau's quote "Anyone can cook" from the film "[Ratatouille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film))." Chef Gusteau's famous quote highlights that talent can emerge in anyone, regardless of background or social status. The film also highlights the importance of following your dreams, the need for persistence and hard work, and the ability to overcome prejudices and social barriers.

Forget what you've heard or read about artificial intelligence replacing programmers and other professions. It's just nonsense from CEOs trying to inflate their products and desperate to attract investors. There aren't enough programmers in the world today to meet the huge demand that software is creating in society. If you want to become a programmer, keep studying and improving. Focus on your goals, learn what you find interesting, and don't compare yourself to anyone else.

## 🦁&nbsp; Zeca, The Neob Mascot

The Neob mascot is the [chimera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(creature)), a mythological creature that emerged in Greece during the 7th century BC. The chimera is characterized by a hybrid appearance of two or more animals (lion, goat, serpent, eagle) and the ability to breathe fire from its nostrils.

The name ZECA is an acronym for "Zero Effort and Cost Abstractions." Neob is a language based on the concepts of *zero-cost abstraction*, and *zero cognitive effort*, in which the resources and abstractions provided are easy to assimilate and do not impose any performance overhead at runtime. The abstractions provided by Neob are compile-time constructs and do not add any additional cost to the final JavaScript code, making it as fast as if you had written the code in JavaScript without the abstractions.
